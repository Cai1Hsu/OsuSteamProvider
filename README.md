# OsuSteamProvider

Provide rich presence for osu! in Steam(using the appid of McOsu).

### WARN
Although reading osu!'s memory without modifying was [approved by peppy](https://i.ppy.sh/6c651103246da60f794606d63b8fc30c3aafd4fa/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f767744337a64302e706e67). But this action is commonly seen in cheating. So I don't know if this will cause a ban. Use it at your own risk. And please write email to accounts@ppy.sh immediately to explain everything if you get banned. Also an issue here to let others know.
